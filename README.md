### Academic Performance Insights 

This project analyzes a Student Performance Dataset using Microsoft Excel to uncover how factors such as gender, parental education, and test preparation courses impact academic outcomes across math, reading, and writing.

- **Dataset Overview**
  
Each row represents a student and includes:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Parental Level of Education
  - Test Preparation Course (Completed/None)
  - Math Score
  - Reading Score
  - Writing Score

- **Objective**
  
  - To analyze academic performance trends and answer:
    
    - Do test preparation courses improve performance?
    - Do gender differences exist in scores?
    - Which parental education levels are linked to higher student performance?

- **Tasks Performed**
  
  1. Data Cleaning & Formatting
     - Checked for missing values and inconsistent formatting
     - Standardized categorical values (e.g., Gender, Test Prep)
     - Ensured numeric formatting for all test scores

 2. Calculated Fields
     - Total Score = Math + Reading + Writing
     - Average Score = Total Score ÷ 3

 3. Data Analysis via Pivot Tables
     - Average score by Gender
     - Score comparison by Parental Education Level
     - Performance trend by Test Preparation Course

- Dashboard Visualizations
  - Built an interactive dashboard including:
    - Bar Chart: Average Scores by Gender
    - Pie Chart: Parental Education Distribution
    - Line Chart: Average Total Score by Test Prep Completion

  - KPI Cards:
    - Average Math Score
    - Average Reading Score
    - Average Writing Score

- Key Insights
  - Does test preparation help?
      - "Yes" , Students who completed the test preparation course consistently scored higher across all three subjects.

  - Are boys or girls performing better?
     - Girls had slightly higher average scores in reading and writing, while boys performed better in math.

  - Which parental background shows the best student performance?
     - Students whose parents had a master’s or bachelor’s degree tended to have higher average scores across subjects, suggesting parental education positively influences academic achievement.

- **Recommendations**
    - Schools should encourage students to complete test preparation courses, especially those underperforming.

    - Tailored learning strategies may help address subject-specific gender gaps.

    - Additional academic support could be provided for students whose parents have lower levels of education, to bridge the performance gap.

- **Tools Used**
  - Microsoft Excel
     - Data Cleaning
     - Calculated Fields
     - Pivot Tables
     - Slicers & Conditional Formatting
     - Charts: Bar, Pie, Line
     - KPI Cards
